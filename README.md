## Usage

This SVG logo maker will prompt the user to choose 1 to 3 letters to go into the shape, choose a TEXT COLOR, SHAPE COLOR, and pick from 3 shapes: Circle, Square or Triangle. Once all selections are made, a link to the user's created SVG logo will appear in the logo.svg file. The user will need to open in live terminal to view their created shape. 

This app is supposed to also use Jest to test the functionality of the app. This function is currently unavailable in this edition of the app.
